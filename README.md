In this project I will test all my acquired knowledge in the first steps 
of the Odin Project, Beginner HTML. By the end of this project I should 
be show casing an ability to show basic understanding of HTML in a 
recipes project.


What I learned?

The use of fundamental HTML in a recipe's project. Showcase competency in a basic level of how to use these tags:

<h1>
<h2>
<P>
<img>
<li>
<ul>
<ol>
<a>

Also, delve a little on the different styling using CSS and giving the page a little more.

Now I know how to create a basic HTML boiler plate along with the basis of the structure of a website project.
